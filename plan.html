            <p>I think this is a good place to take a step back and explain what my plan was. In late March, I informed my manager I would be leaving my team at Google to pursue an education in becoming a web developer. </p>
            <p><em>The timeline </em></p>

            <p>My last day on my team at Google would be April 19. I was taking a leave of absence for 3 months that would allow me to attend a program and return by the end, searching for a job within the company but with a foot already in the door. April 19 was an arbitrary deadline I had set with the goal of forcing myself to follow through with my plan.</p>

            <p><em>The program</em></p>

            <p>A coding bootcamp in San Francisco. I applied to both Hack Reactor, a front-end focused program that teaches JavaScript, and App Academy, which covered the full stack and focused on Ruby on Rails. </p>

            <p><em>The Application Process</em></p>

            <p><b>Hack Reactor:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Requires an application to be filled out along with a few essay questions</li>

              <li>Has an initial “fit” interview at their office or over Skype</li>

              <li>Has a follow-up technical interview that requires applicants to draw on JavaScript knowledge (or just learn JS before the actual interview date)</li>

              <li>Sends applicants home to work on constructing an app</li>

              <li>Holds another follow-up technical interview, likely to make you prove you actually built the app yourself</li>

              <li>Charges $18K up front for its 12-week program</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>App Academy:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Requires an application to be filled out along with a few essay questions</li>

                <li>Gives you an online coding exam testing your Ruby knowledge, essentially expecting you have gone through the full Codecademy.com Ruby module and done some extra reading and practice with the language</li>

                <li>Requires you do sixty hours worth of the program’s pre-work and tutorials</li>

                <li>Administers an additional online exam</li>

                <li>Has a final interview with, you guessed it, yet another online exam</li>

                <li>Charges nothing up front for its program, takes 15% of your first year salary over the first six months of employment if you find a job after graduating the program</li>
              </ul>

            <p><em>My Approach</em></p>

            <p>Chaos. I started by applying to App Academy, passed the first exam after teaching myself Ruby in a week, and after being surprised by the requisite prework I would have to do, decided to apply to Hack Reactor. Then, after two interviews with Hack Reactor and getting the feeling that they were looking more for applicants who had studied Computer Science in school (and that they charged $18K for 12 weeks), decided to postpone that application and go back to applying to App Academy. It was chaos. </p>

            <p>Both programs required extensive prework to apply and, after realizing about two weeks into the prework that I wouldn’t be ready in time to start Hack Reactor at the end of April, made a lateral move and started applying to App Academy. In retrospect, I probably should have just picked one program and applied with full force to that instead of applying to multiple programs because that forced me to swap between two different languages when I had almost no programming background (imagine having never learned a new language in your life and suddenly trying to learn Persian and then sidetracking to Hindi before pivoting back to Persian again within the course of a month... that was my April 2013). Needless to say, my lack of direction and focus with it probably set me back in terms of trying to start a program within my set timeline that would afford me the ability to return to Google within my three-month leave of absence window. </p>
