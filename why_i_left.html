        <h3><a href="#">Why I Left Google</a></h3>
        <h6>Written by <a href="#">Youssif Abdulhamid</a> on May 1, 2013.</h6>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-11 columns">
            <p>I was 22 years old, recently graduated from college at the nadir of The Great Recession, when it happened: the pocket vibration that would change my life. I scrambled for my flip phone, my trembling hands careful not to disrupt the meticulously architected duct-tape job holding it together. In the blur of the moment, my thoughts raced back to the rejection e-mails, the career fairs teases, my parents questioning why I chose not to apply to medical school, my resigned fate as just another hundredth of a decimal point in a statistic I’d hear on NPR the next morning.</p>

            <p>I checked the caller ID and recognized the 650 area code: Silicon Valley. My head was swimming such a torrid current of hope and terror, my mind<a href="http://movieclips.com/2gfPm-old-school-movie-thats-the-way-you-debate/" > blacked out like Will Ferrell in Old School</a> during the actual conversation. All I remember is that Google – the same Google I laughed about applying to when my mother suggested I try and get a job there only a few months before, because<a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2010/09/14/one-half-of-one-percent-of-google-applicants-get-hired-heres-how-it-works/" > nobody gets hired there</a> – wanted to hire me. Me! It was the happiest day of my life. It still is.</p>

            <p> It has been almost exactly three years since that day. The memory still brings a lump in my throat. Three years ago, I hit the jackpot.</p>

            <p>And today I am walking away.</p>

            <p>For the past year, I’d been wrestling with this quote by MIT professor Noam Chomsky and others like it: “All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume.” Three years into living the dream, I found my existence slowly being reduced to a trance. A routine. It all felt too easy: get paid, enjoy the<a href="http://www.quora.com/Working-at-Google-1/What-is-the-best-Google-employee-perk-and-why" > incredible perks</a> of working at Google, listen to people gush over how smart I must be to work at Google (a perk in its own right for someone with my insecurities), and remind companies how dumb they are for throwing away money on billboard space instead of targeting people who are actually searching for their products (you’d be surprised…). </p>

            <p>I slipped into an existential crisis. Did I truly “reach happily ever after” at age 22? Was this it? Or was I just another deaf-blind-and-dumb sheep, slowly being buried into another Chomsky quote or Orwellian allegory?</p>

            <p>This isn’t meant to be my sob story. I wasn’t unhappy at Google. In fact, I want to make one point clear: I loved every minute of working there. I owe them so much and I am unbelievably grateful for the opportunity they gave me. The only other groups of people I can think that have made me feel any more valued and appreciated are my family and closest friends. Any time I get asked if I’d recommend working there, I practically dive out of my pants in an enthusiastic “<a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/bc44db728fb24463ddd3e4f11b9e434b/tumblr_mi1nj2YkPt1rqfhi2o1_250.gif" >YES</a>!” If I ever decide I do want to work at a large corporation again, Google undoubtedly tops my short list. Actually, Google is the list.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t unhappy. But there was an itch on my back I just couldn’t reach with the way things were. There were too many variables out of my control with my life, too much of who I was and what I could become that I couldn’t reach with my own hands. I had to rely on someone else to do it. Only, it wasn’t just someone else. It was an entire organization of pseudo-decision makers. And, as a result of the inevitable career movement inherent with any group of uber-ambitious and intelligent people, the individuals comprising this organization of pseudo-decision makers was constantly changing.</p>

            <p>Some of this is by design and some of it by institutional oversight. I was frustrated because it was never clear where that line was drawn. I suspect my own plight runs reminiscent enough to anyone at an entry-level or just-above-entry-level job. I went from being grateful I had a job to developing a legitimate fear of falling through the very real cracks that seemed to be forming in every direction and tailoring everything I did or said to avoiding those cracks. I found myself evolving into someone else. And that’s when I realized I was feeling helpless, that the only role I might quickly have anywhere would be to ratify decisions and consume. Yes, I realize perspective is everything and that my perceived predicament could be viewed in many other, more positive ways. But even with that in mind, this was still how I viewed things. I may have made a more pointed attempt at modifying my viewpoint if I felt my outlook would result in anything but a journey of self-realization.</p>

            <p>But I didn’t.</p>

            And here we are.
