            <p>Each day offers a fresh beat of exhilaration. The feeling that literally every move I make -- every moment costing me time that could be otherwise invested in my family, friends, and fun -- is my own decision, independent of social pressures, brings its own unique high. </p>

            <p>Having dropped out of the Hack Reactor application process in favor of App Academy, I now have officially one program I can be accepted into that fits with the leave of absence I have arranged with Google.</p>

            <p>I am in the process of knocking out the 60 hours of App Academy prework. If I do well on that, I will be invited to take a timed coding exam (my second of the process) as the next step in the process. The exercises are challenging, but every conquest has its reward; small personal victories against The Machine. Programming, I’ve found, is a brilliantly rewarding experience. There exist moments of despair and frustration, confusion and self-doubt. But once that error message disappears; once that RSpec test passes; once the blinking cursor on the black terminal screen spits out green instead of red… programming brings its own unique high. </p>

            <p>And yet, the clock ticks on. </p>

            <p>The prework is taking me longer than I originally anticipated. Challenges you face while coding are not a matter of simply writing things out; once the wall is hit, it stays hit until the bulb lights and you identify your mental lapse against the machine. Sometimes, that requires throwing in the towel and calling a quits at 3:30 AM to look at it with a clear head the next morning. But I don’t have enough nights to spare towards my deadline. The application process is taking me longer than I expected; I expected to have been accepted into a program before I left Google. At best, I will know in about a week’s time. My arbitrary deadline, the “backing of my troops against the ocean”... it all feels so naive. </p>

            <p>Every coding exercise begins to feel more like Revenge of the Nerds than it does a new learning experience.</p>

            <p>The best I can do is run. I run furiously. I run at night, I run in the morning. I run up steep 50 degree inclines for miles at a time. I run until the problem racing through my head tires out and affords me some clear space in there. </p>

            <p>And yet, the clock ticks on. </p>

            <p>The pragmatist within me (the pesky mole likes to stay buried, but will sneak his head out the ground on occasion) prompts me to start hedging my bets a bit -- just in case this whole App Academy thing doesn’t quite work out. <a href="http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/What-are-the-best-programming-bootcamps-courses-available-in-the-United-States" >Browsing through Quora, I stumble upon a program</a> listed called MakerSquare based in Austin. It’s the program with the nearest start date and completely overlaps with all the Ruby I have been learning. More importantly, my sister recently decided to move out there for a teaching job, and I have never been to Texas. I figure it could be an interesting summer adventure, in light of the growing realization that App Academy could very well not pan out for me. So I take a shot in the dark and apply. </p>

            And the clock ticks on.
