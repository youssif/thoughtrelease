            <p>April 21st, 11 AM. I woke in a panic, feeling guilty for having slept at all -- let alone, sleeping in until almost noon. The feeling of remorse would later prove routine in the coming weeks, but it was the first time I had experienced it. In five days, I would be leaving my job life at Google, with only a thread of a plan in place for what would come next. </p>

            <p>High-level view, my plan was to teach myself how to code so that I would have the necessary skills to become a programmer. While I was enjoying my job, the energy did not feel right. The fulfillment wasn’t quite there, and I was beginning to feel like I was doing what I was doing only because I was afraid not to. Steve Jobs once stated, “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”</p>

            <p>That was the high-level view. In low-level reality, I was leaving my job to apply to programming schools in the area with the hope that I would be accepted into one. But by this point, I was quickly realizing that acceptance into a program would be roughly two to three times as difficult as I had originally projected. I’d set an arbitrary end-date weeks ago with the intention of backing my troops against the ocean and fighting with desperation. My hypothesis held that the only way to counter true inertia would be through self-imposed desperation. But with just five days left before my leave, I was caught victim to my recent decision to change course and apply to a different program (App Academy) than the one I was applying to before (Hack Reactor). After realizing that Hack Reactor: </p>

            <p>a) Would take longer to apply to than originally anticipated and that getting accepted into the cohort that fit with my three-month leave of absence would be nearly impossible</p>

            <p>b) Didn’t really meet what I wanted to get out of a program</p>

            <p>c) Didn’t really take beginner anymore</p>

            <p>d) Charged about $18K for its 12 week program,</p>

            <p>I decided I would shift my attention back to App Academy. One could call it an audible, but it was more of a scramble resulting from a broken play.</p>

            <p>I felt guilty for having slept at all. The clock was ticking and I had roughly sixty hours of prework left to do for my App Academy application. </p>

            <p>For the first time since I had decided to make the plunge, I let the whispers get to me. Whispers that I was throwing my life away, suspicions I was in the situation I faced not out of my own fruition but because I somehow wasn’t good enough to stay at Google, and everything in between (Sidenote: Be careful what you say about someone and to whom, because there usually is a 105% to 118% chance it will get back to him/her). Winter was coming. It was the Sunday before my last week at Google, and I suddenly had no confidence in my ability to follow through with my plan of becoming a developer.</p>

            <p>Was I simply an arrogant person? Looking through the lens of the 22-year-old college student I once was facing a waterfall of uncertainty in his ability to land a job after graduation, it certainly seemed that way. Who was I to forsake a prestigious job at one of the best companies to work for? A company that gave me my start? Had I let my ego get the best of me and allowed myself to lose the perspective I once promised myself I never would? I was on a track to make a change in my life with exactly no evidence that I was capable of it. </p>

            <p>Up until this point, I was confident in the overall plan. But the flood of details were now gushing through my cracking levee of philosophically principled living. Inertia meeting desperation. Insecurity checking confidence. Pragmatism fighting back against idealism. My two selves, finally colliding in an epic battle.</p>

            <p>It was suddenly sinking in. Soul-food Friday lunches; the free coffee barista who knew my order by heart; the afternoon beach volleyball matches; my rapidly growing frequent-flyer status; the discounted flights to visit my family in Michigan; the free shuttle rides from Mountain View to San Francisco and the bubble they created, incubating a culture I can’t imagine most people would ever quite understand. Hell, the promotion I could be up for in a month. All about to end. </p>

            <p>With nothing to show for it.</p>

            <p>I would go into work Monday and be asked if I knew yet which school I would be attending. And I would respond eloquently, with confidence, but without an answer. And I would then project onto the asker what I thought they were really thinking, simultaneously attempting to convince myself that I didn’t care. </p>

            <p>But on that Sunday, I cared. I panicked. And that experience would seep into the rest of my week. The self-doubt, in its migration from periphery to inescapable distraction, would permeate my life. For the rest of the following week, I regretted my decision and hated myself for being such an arrogant prick to have lost all perspective in my decision to leave. </p>

            <p>The funny thing is, I could have backtracked at any point and life would have returned to normal. But I didn’t. Google, my team, HR would have welcomed me back with a warm embrace. Yet I carried on in the face of self-doubt. Maybe it was only to save face, maybe I wanted it badly enough, maybe I was just self-destructive. </p>

            <p>
            Looking back though, I think it came down to setting the deadline and sticking to it. To backing my troops against the ocean. Master plans are plotted, but it takes real effort to stick to them. Forcing myself to make the plunge was probably more important than the plan itself. It compelled me forward when a major part of me doubted whether or not the abyss was crossable. I probably could have done a better job mitigating for risk and adhering to a plan, but in retrospect I wouldn’t have changed a thing. Because there is so much uncertainty, one can get lost in the chaos of details and pragmatism. And lose sight of a simple fact: it’s easier to believe what people think when that belief means a more comfortable existence, even if that means giving up on your dreams -- no matter how crazy they seem to an outsider. </p>
